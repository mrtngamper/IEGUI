swinir: SwinIR
swinir_short: A tool for image denoising and super-resolution
swinir_long: "SwinIR can perform a few image restoration tasks. At image super-resolution, image denoising and jpeg
artifact reduction it achieves state-of-the-art-performance. Image super-resolution can be used to convert
smaller images into bigger images to improve their quality, with mixed results. Enhanced graphics often look very good, while
real world images don't always. Image densoising can also be selected to remove noise from grainy images. That works reasonably well
most of the time, but NAFNet, another method provided with IEGUI, can sometimes produce better results."

nafnet: NAFNet
nafnet_short: A tool for image deblurring and denoising
nafnet_long: "NAFNet can perform image deblurring and denoising tasks very well. Deblurring can be used for images which
were taken without stabilization, and are therefore a bit hazy, which is the case with most smartphone images. The denoising option
can remove the grain from images quite well."

wb: Automatic white balance
wb_short: A tool for automatic AI supported white balancing
wb_long: "Auto White-Balance Correction for Mixed-Illuminant Scenes is a white balancing technique which doesn't simply try to correct
the whole scene using the same profile, but tries to estimate differently enlightened  parts of an image and then apply different settings
for each part. It can achieve very good results with images containing differently illuminated scenes, a scenario with which smartphone cameras
tend to struggle a lot. A disadvantage with this method is, that the less sharpness an image has, the poorer is the output"

llie: Low light image enhancement
llie_short: Enlightens low light images
llie_long: "This tool allows for enlightenment of very low light images, and is very fast by doing so it can also handle large images.
Its disadvantage is, that it often times messes up the white balance. To a certain extend that can oftentimes be corrected with the
tool for automatic white balance, but in general LLFlow produces better results."

llflow: LLFlow
llflow_short: Enlightens low light images
llflow_long: "This tool can enlighten low light images very well, with the disadvantage of it being very slow."

gpen: GPEN
gpen_short: A method for face restoration
gpen_long: "GPEN (GAN Prior Embedded Network) can mainly restore faces. There are 3 options, all of which work much better with close-ups, 
such as selfies, than with pictures where the face is further away. First, face enhancement to enhance and enlarge poor quality face images. 
Second option is to colorize black and white images. And last option is to remove impurities from images. Usually only works with white lines, 
i.e. you have to paint over the impurities with white lines manually beforehand."
