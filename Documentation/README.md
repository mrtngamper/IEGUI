## Requirements
The team was given the task to develop a program using an object-oriented programming language
wich has a graphical user interface. The team should provide documentation, select a software development process, 
document daily changes, use git as a version control system and use a test environment. The development was set to three weeks.

The team decided to create a GUI  which allows the user to open
image files, select an artificial-intelligence-supported enhance-algorithm 
and store the output into a new file.
These algorithms are mostly state-of-the-art algorithms in their respective field and released on GitHub.
The team also chose to enable the program to switch language during runtime and include a tutorial.

### Enhance algorithms
The team chose to implement the following options

### Programming languages and frameworks

The team also chose to use these programming languages and frameworks. 

| Task              | Language/Frameworks/Tools |
|:------------------|:--------------------------|
| GUI               | JavaFX                    |  
| Backend           | Java                      |   
| Image enhancement | Preferably python         |
| Tests             | JUnit                     |
| Documentation     | Markdown + Java Docs      |
| Collaboration     | WhatsApp                  |
| Diagram creation  | StarUML                   |
| VCS               | Git on GitHub             |

### Development process
For development the team chose to use the __*waterfall model*__. Since it was given very little
time a linear approach seemed appropriate.

#### Waterfall model
The basic waterfall model breaks down a development process into five phases with their respective results.

- System and software requirements ->  requirements document
- Design -> software architecture
- Coding -> development, proving, and integration of software
- Testing -> discovery and debugging of defects
- Operations -> installation, migration and maintenance

The downside of this process is the lack of flexibility. As the requirements were very clear the team decided that an iterative
model would not be necessary.
Furthermore, the model was mainly used as a reference. The team decided to allow minimal changes of the design during the
development process if the whole team was informed.

## Design




## Daily documentation

### Design
#### 09-05-22
- __Up to Commit: Update README.md__ <br> 
A GitHub repository was created and a basic README was uploaded. Collaborators
were added to the repository and every collaborator was given a branch.

#### 10-05-22
- The planning phase began, the requirements were established and a basic use-case-diagram was created.

#### 11-05-22
- __Commit: JavaFX Setup__ <br>
A basic JavaFX project folder was uploaded to the repository

#### 12-05-22
- Basic classes were defined and a basic class diagram was created

- __Up to Commit: Further Preparation and Experimentation__ <br>
An updated JavaFX project folder was uploaded with a basic class and
folder design including JavaDoc documentation. The SwinIR project folder was embedded into
the IEGUI folder structure. A settings file was added to the config folder in SwinIR as well as an implementation of
a reader for the settings as a proof of concept to test the yaml file format.

- __Commit: Concept__ <br>
The UIConcept.md file was added to the repository. It contained basic information about the UI design with reference images.


### Finished design and start of coding phase

#### 13-05-22
- During that day the coding phase began after the basic inner workings of IEGUI were defined. Before the Tasks for each developer were specified.
- __Commit: Concept__ <br>
The UIConcept.md was extended with detailed descriptions for the different views as well as a basic folder and class structure.
- __Commit: Language__ <br>
The language backend was defined in the UIConcept.md file
- __Commit: Language backend__ <br>
The language backend was implemented.

#### 17-05-22
- __Commit: Settings__ <br>
A Settings implementation has been made. It provided the option to store and load data contained
in an instance of context.
- __Commit: WelcomeView + MainView merged__ <br>
The two views and their affiliated controllers have been merged. The main application has also been adapted.

#### 18-05-22
- __Commit: Fix WelcomeView__ <br>
Fixed bug which resulted in a NullPointerException

#### 19-05-22
- __Commit: MainView upload picture feature__ <br>
A button to choose a the picture to process with an additional drag and drop option and picture display has
been implemented.

#### 20-05-22
- __Commit: Create and setup python environment__ <br>
Code to setup an environment for SwinIR was added to ImageEnhanceMethod.java as well as SwinIR.java
- __Commit: Fix: Drag and Drop__ <br>
Fixed the feature so it behaved exactly like the button.

#### 24-05-22
- __Commits by mrtngmaper up to Low-light enhancement, SwinIR, Auto-white-balance working__ <br>
Additional enhance-methods were added to the project, a standard implementation of start() was moved
from SwinIR to ImageEnhanceMethod, as the other enhance-methods could use the same backend, while using
different execution commands, which could be added via the getCMD() method, every ImageEnhanceMethod must implement.

#### 25-05-22
- __Commit: Method display__ <br>
First version of the display of all available methods with title and short description.

#### 26-05-22


#### 27-05-22
- __Commit: Two additional methods__ <br>
  Two additional enhance-methods were added to the project (LLFlow, NAFNet). All model files were removed from the project and added to Google Drive,
  because GitHub only allows file sizes up to 100mb.

#### 28-05-22
- This documentation was added to the project, the Concept.md became obsolete.



## Temporary resume 
#### What worked
Up until June 28th, one week from the deadline, the development team was able
to create basic implementations of the different views wich were previously specified.
The WelcomeView was implemented, it was possible to select or drag & drop images 
into the MainView. It was also possible to run enhance images using a simple interface in jave.

#### What did not
It was still not possible to select an image-enhance-method from the GUI and descriptions
for the different algorithms were still missing, as well as settings nodes for the methods.
The overall design of the different views could still be improved.
Languages other than english were still not available.

#### Perspective
It seemed to be possible to finish the project during the following week, even though
there might not be left much time. The right development process was chosen, as only very few
design specifications had to be changed, the most server being the need for an installer, because of the GitHub file size limitation.

## Resume
The project is still under development
